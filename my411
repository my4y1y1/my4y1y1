If you take out a payday loan, you will likely be charged a fee of between $10 and $30 for every $100 borrowed. A $15 per $100 fee is typical. So, if you have an emergency and need $300 today, you would have to pay back $345 in a couple of weeks, assuming a fee of $15 per $100 borrowed. If your budget is already tight, that may be hard to do. In those states that do not ban or limit renewals or rollovers,the payday lender may encourage you to pay just the fee and extend the loan another few weeks. In that case, you would spend $45 and still owe $345 when the extension is over – that means you’re spending $90 to borrow $300 for one month.
